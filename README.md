# CMS-KIT-SANITY

An endeavor accumulating the experience and best practices collected at Focus Reactive. The project service the idea of making Headless CMS-based development accessible, comfortable, and fast. 

## What is CMS-KIT?

CMS is the collection of ideas and their tech implementations in order to change the way of how we develop modern marketing and eCommerce websites. What it includes:

- **Boilerplate**. Contains all necessary customizations and integrations for seamless interaction with Headless CMS.
- **Auto Deployment**. Automatically set up accounts in Headless CMS and hosting on Vercel. Connects everything to each other and to the repository on Github. Set env variables, connect webhooks and upload initial demo content.
- **CMS Setup**. Contains the necessary plugins and settings for CMS. Generates content model based on available components. Deeply integrates Components Set with CMS for the best editorial experience.
- **Starter components kit**. Adds a starter components kit (one or more) with everything you need for integration with CMS and for further development of your project.
- Project **Structure** and development **guidelines**. The project is aimed at long-term development and provides everything necessary for scaling and adding new features. It does not restrict developers in their intentions but gently encourages developers on how to quickly develop and model new components
