# CMS-KIT-SANITY

An endeavor accumulating the experience and best practices collected at Focus Reactive. The project serves the idea of making Headless CMS-based development accessible, comfortable, and fast. 

## What is CMS-KIT?

CMS is the collection of ideas and their tech implementations to change how we develop modern marketing and eCommerce websites. What it includes:

- **Boilerplate**. Contains all necessary customizations and integrations for seamless interaction with Headless CMS.
- **Auto Deployment**. Automatically set up accounts in Headless CMS and hosting on Vercel. Connect everything to each other, and to the repository on GitHub. Set environment variables, connect webhooks, and upload initial demo content.
- **CMS Setup**. This contains the necessary plugins and settings for CMS. It generates a content model based on available components. It deeply integrates the Components Set with CMS for the best editorial experience.
- **Starter components kit**. Adds a starter components kit (one or more) with everything you need for integration with CMS and further development of your project.
- Project **Structure** and development **guidelines**. The project is aimed at long-term development and provides everything necessary for scaling and adding new features. It does not restrict developers in their intentions but gently encourages developers on how to develop and model new components quickly

## For who?

- **Developers**. Can quickly start the project in minutes and go fast in component development.
- **Content Editors**. Intuitive navigation and visual preview of what they're creating.
- **Project managers**. Can test the system without developers (see one-click rollout).
- **Teams**.  Develop content and new features in parallel. Fast time to market.
